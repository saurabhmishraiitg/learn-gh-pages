# About GH Pages

## Concepts

- `default.html`
    — The base layout that lays the foundation for subsequent layouts. The derived layouts inject their contents into this file at the line that says `{{ content }}` and are linked to this file via FrontMatter declaration.
- `home.html`
    — The layout for your landing-page / home-page / index-page.
- `page.html`
  - The layout for your documents that contain FrontMatter, but are not posts.
